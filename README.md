# SolgRLT

SolgRLT, or Solg's RealmList Tool, is a program scripted in C# to rewrite/modify a realmlist.wtf on a World of Warcraft 3.3.5 client. The rewritten file include a list of servers for that client, listed by categories, currently;

- [x1/Blizzlike]
- [Cusom/Alternative]

I am always looking for new servers to add to the program. Message me, MrSolg_ to add your own servers, or ones you know of and would like to see in SolgRLT.
